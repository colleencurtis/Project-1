      	<p>Hi, I'm Colleen Curtis. Here's a collection of anecdotes from my travels, focusing on design, photography, and wanderlust.</p>

      		<h2>Reflections</h2>
      		<h3>Venice, Italy</h3>
      		<p>For my final photography project in the last days of my Italian venture, I focused on capturing unusual moments in the waterways around Venice. I used water as a tool of abstraction, to morph the seemingly ordinary reflections of buildings and boats into studies of light and color.</p>

      		<h2>Colors</h2>
      		<h3>Burano, Italy</h3>
      		<p>Burano, a small island near Venice, boasts incredible colors on every house and store. The island is a designer's paradise, filled with hand-crafted glass and vividly painted houses. I experimented with color and texture in my photographs, becoming increasingly abstract.</p>

      		<h2>The Fish</h2>
      		<h3>Venice, Italy</h3>
      		<p>Growing up near the ocean has accustomed me to the sound of water - so Venice, surrounded by water, felt like home. From the winding streets to the labyrinthine waterways, Venice still felt mysterious, even after a month of living there. The island, shaped like a fish, held new discoveries every day - I only had to go out with my camera and search for them.</p>

      		<h2>Arno</h2>
      		<h3>Florence, Italy</h3>
      		<p>Lacking a sense of direction, I set out from the heart of Florence to wander towards the river. Instead of meticulously planning my time, I was able discover Florence at my own pace, photographing sidewalk chalk portraits, cobblestone streets, and eventually, the Arno river. The wide expanse of the Arno housed an ancient bridge and glorious sunset reflections, but the long walk there was even better than the destination itself.</p>

      		<h2>Climb</h2>
      		<h3>Florence, Italy</h3>
      		<p>Booking a Saturday trip to Florence last-minute meant that both the Accademia and Uffizi museums were completely sold out. In lieu of viewing the David or the Birth of Venus, I stood in line for 3.75 hours in the rain to enter the Duomo. After climbing 463 stairs - in which a fellow group member fainted, and I learned that I am not claustrophobic but certainly not a fan of small spaces - I reached the top of Florence's famed church, and the views gave me a perspective that made it all worth it.</p>

      		<h2>Fortuna</h2>
      		<h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
      		<p>Towards the final days of my stay in Rome I visited the Trevi Fountain, a famed tourist destination. According to legend, if you throw a coin into the fountain, you'll return to Rome. Naturally, the scene was swarming with eager tourists trying to reach the fountain. Short of lobbing a coin 30 feet into the air and hoping it somehow found its way into the fountain and did not harm anyone in the vicinity, I could not complete this tradition. Instead, I decided to save the coin and press my luck - if I'm meant to return to Rome, someday, I will.</p>

      		<h2>When In Rome</h2>
      		<h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
      		<p>While studying abroad in Rome I was able to explore history and photography. Using a rented DSLR camera, I could capture moments of abstraction amongst everyday scenes. Every ounce of Rome came with a storied past, and I could connect the sights my teacher described to the mythological and historical tales I grew up reading about, always a bibliophile.</p>

      		<h2>Heights</h2>
      		<h3>Monteverde Cloud Forest, Costa Rica</h3>
      		<p>I've always had a strange relationship with heights - I love being high up, and looking at the details of the intricate world below. It's beautiful, and breathtaking. But I'm also petrified of heights, specifically, of getting back down. In Costa Rica, I was given the opportunity to zip line through the cloud forest, speeding down the mountain with minimal support - my nightmare. But I journeyed up to the top of the forest in a rickety cable car, testing my limits regardless. </p>

      		<h2>The End of the World, and the Beginning</h2>
      		<h3>Irazu Volcano, Costa Rica</h3>
      		<p>My first international travel experience brought me to Costa Rica, to study volcanoes with a college science class. Hiking volcanoes to look at rocks and soil types was not my area of expertise, but it was incredible to stand at the top of each ridge and look into the cloud layers, which obscured everything below. In Costa Rica I discovered a love for new experiences, and became determined to try things I never imagined before.</p>

      		<h2>Home</h2>
      		<h3>Swampscott, Massachusetts</h3>
      		<p>From a small town just north of Boston, I grew up loving both art and photography. Some of my earliest attempts with a camera included walks to Foster Pond, to observe the swans that nested there each year. The rich environment - from the wetlands behind my neighborhood to the ocean at the edge of town - encouraged my curiosity about the natural world.</p>
